# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
  The ability to deconstruct data that seems complicated and present it in an easier-to-understand and appealing way that anyone, even those who donâ€™t know what Data Analysis is about can understand.


I am thrilled to announce that I have completed an "HR Analytics Dashboard", with primary KPIs including total employees, attrition rate, active employees, and average age. Additionally, the dashboard features secondary KPIs such as attrition by education, department, and age group, with filters for education field and department.

This project contains the following Steps:-
1. Import the Excel files
2. Data Cleaning and Data Transformations in Power Query.
3. Data Processing
4. KPIs
5. Created charts and graphs and designed an Interactive report to analyze and visualize the data.

Here's how I did it:-
1. I used the HR analytics dataset.
2. Transformed data using Excel
3. Created various data visualizations using Excel
4. Putting all visualizations together and building an interactive dashboard.

Insights:-
1. The average age of employees is 37.
2. Total number of employees is 1470.
3. The percentage of male employees is greater than female employees.
4. The highest number of employees in the Research & Development department.
